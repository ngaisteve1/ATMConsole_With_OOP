# ATMConsole_With_OOP
Implemented Object-Oriented Programming like interface, class and object. Use cases: Login. Check Balance. Place Deposit. Make Withdrawal. Third party transfer. View transactions.

### Software Development Summary
- Technology: C#
- Framework: .NET Core 2.2
- Project Type: Console
- IDE: Visual Studio Code (Version 1.31.1)
- Paradigm or pattern of programming: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Data: Data of this demo program (Bank Account and Transaction data) are stored using List objects. No database is used on purpose for this demo version.

A system which allow user to key in ATM card no and PIN no. If card no and PIN no is correct, user will be given the access to:

- view bank transaction
- If user key in the wrong pin more than 3 times, the bank account will be locked.
